Welcome to my **C++ Daily Practice Journey**!
This repository is my commitment to mastering **C++** through consistent daily effort — blending **fundamentals, OOP concepts, and Data Structures & Algorithms** one step at a time.

I started this repo to:

* 📘 Track my daily **C++ coding progress**
* 🧠 Strengthen **problem-solving and algorithmic thinking**
* ⚡ Explore **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in depth
* 🛠️ Practice **STL and advanced C++ features**
* 🟦 Build a solid foundation for **competitive programming & software development**
* 📈 Maintain my **GitHub contribution streak** with meaningful commits

## 📅 My Goal

> 📌 **One valuable C++-related commit per day.**

It could be a solved DSA problem, an OOP concept implementation, STL exploration, or even a mini project — anything that sharpens my **C++ skills**, shared daily.

## 🔧 Topics I Plan to Cover

Basics (Syntax, Operators, Data Types, I/O)

Control Flow (Conditionals & Loops)

Functions & Recursion

Arrays, Strings & Pointers

OOP: Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Overloading, Friend Functions

Templates (Function & Class)

STL: Vectors, Maps, Sets, Queues, Stacks, Priority Queues

Exception & File Handling

Dynamic Memory Management

DSA: Sorting, Searching, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Heaps, Greedy, DP

Mini Projects & Problem-Solving most used languages, contribution graph, streak stats) at the bottom of the README? That makes repos look even more professional.
